### Sample Program
```java
/* square root of a number */
import java.lang.Math;
class SquareRoot
{
 public static void main(String args[])
 {
  double x=5; 
  double y; 
  y=Math.sqrt(x);
  System.out.println("y= "+y);
 }
}
```
<p> in Math.sqrt, MATH is class name and
SQRT is a method of that class. </p>

### Java program structure

1. Documentation (optional)
   program name/author details in comments
2. Package statement (optional)
   this means that classes defined in the 
   program, belongs to this package.
3. Import statement (optional)
   importing methods from java library.
4. Interface statement (optional)
   Also like a class, will be discussed later.
5. class definition (important)
   java is a purely object oriented language,
   everything is dependent on the classes.
6. main method class 
   the execution of the program starts from here.
